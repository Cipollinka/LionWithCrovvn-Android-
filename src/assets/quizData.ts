          "The Nile crocodile is one of the largest and most aggressive crocodile species, with adults reaching lengths of up to 20 feet and weighing up to 1,650 pounds. They have a long, powerful body covered in tough, scaly skin, a broad snout, and strong jaws lined with sharp teeth. Nile crocodiles are ambush predators, lying in wait near the water's edge to capture prey that comes to drink. Their diet includes fish, birds, and mammals, and they are known to be highly opportunistic, even taking down large animals like zebras and antelope.",
